Acceptance Specification
========================

Objectives
----------

The purpose of this document is to create an end-user test object list (TOL)
for Aether Connected Edge (ACE).

This document will focus on the connectivity services end-user testing.  In the
future, this document will extend to other services offered through ACE.

The Automated continuous testing framework for the platform is out of the scope of this document.

Integration Test (eNB-LTE Core)
-------------------------------

Before we start to test End-to-End connectivity, we have to check the
connection (called S1-MME/S1-C interface) between eNB in an edge and MME in a
public cloud.

In order to verify this connectivity, the following test cases should be passed.

Note that all the following test/verification cases have some assumptions:

1. eNB is connected to the Fabric switch;
2. eNB has correct network configurations;
3. eNB has correct ID configurations provided by the ONF PMFE team.

IT-TOL01 Fabric Test 1: the connectivity test within the edge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to test the fabric test, please see the following steps:

+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

.. note::
   it depends on the eNB device. Some eNBs have a single network interface for the management network, S1-U, and S1-C,
   while other eNBs have separate interfaces. The former eNB type has a single IP address,
   and the later eNB type has multiple IP addresses for each interface.

IT-TOL02 Fabric Test 2: the connectivity test between the eNB and the public cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to test the fabric test, please see the following steps:

+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+



.. note::
   it also depends on the eNB device. Some eNBs allow us to SSH into their device, other eNBs provide the PING tool through Web GUI.
   Of course, some eNBs do not support both. In that case, it is okay to skip this test case.


IT-TOL03 SCTP Connection Verification

+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------+

Capture the traffic with Wireshark or the command: `sudo tcpdump -i any sctp`

.. note::
   the eNB should have the gateway IP address for the S1-MME/S1-C traffic.
   You can SSH there with the gateway IP address in the eNB and capture the traffic.
   Normally, the gateway device can be one of those devices: (i) VPN router; (ii) Firewall device in between VPN router and the edge;
   (iii) one of edge servers.

Connectivity Services
---------------------

Aether provides only data connectivity for end-user devices and systems.
So the voice service over LTE is not available. However, users can use
any OTT services over the Aether network for voice connectivity.

The test specifications are only covering the data connectivity focused tests.

To test bandwidth available to a mobile device over Aether network.

Please note the following, the bandwidth test depends on the eNB hardware,
your local breakout bandwidth, and the overall radio environment.
If you face an unexpected result, please explain it in the comment section in the outcome column.
